# :arrows_counterclockwise: Unit 14 Sequelize Homework: Reverse Engineering Code  :arrows_clockwise:

## Instructions
Reverse engineer the starter code provided in `Develop/` and create a tutorial for the code.

Inspect the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining *every* file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

At the end of the tutorial, add instructions for how you could now add changes to this project.

## Business Context
When joining a new team, you will be expected to inspect a lot of code that you have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for you, you will dissect the code by yourself, saving any questions for a member of your team.

## User Story
* AS A developer
  I WANT a walk-through of the codebase
  SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
  GIVEN a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport
  WHEN I follow the walkthrough
  THEN I understand the codebase
```
